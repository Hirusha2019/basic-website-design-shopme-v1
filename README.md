# basic-website-design-shopme_v1
For my final assessment in Web Design for Beginners course module, I created my first simple web page of an ecommerce website named “ShopMe” using basic HTML and CSS.

Here is a brief explanation of how I designed my webpage and its functionality.

I divided the webpage into several main sections to smooth navigation. They are Header, Products section, About section, FAQ section, Contact section and Footer.

Header section:- 
The header section contains the name and logo of my site and a navigation menu. The navigation links allow users to jump over from one section to another section. I added hover effects on navigation links to provide user-friendly visual feedback.

Products section:- 
In the products section, several products are displayed in a grid layout with names, images, and prices for easy browsing. I also added a hover animation on product cards for better user experience. 

About section:- 
The about section introduces the purpose of the website and highlights its main features under the sub-section named “Why Shop With Us?” by using an unordered list. 

FAQ section:- 
The FAQ section is implemented to provide quick answers for common questions of users by using a table format.

Contact section:- 
This section includes a contact form where users can provide their name, email, and a message to reach us. The form includes a basic HTML form validation method. 
And I implemented a JavaScript function named “submitForm” to alert as “Message sent successfully!”, when user submit the form using the “Send Message” button.

Footer:- 
The footer section divided into three sub sections named “footer-top”, “footer-body” and “footer-bottom”. Footer top includes a brief introduction paragraph about the company and Footer bottom includes a copyright notice. Footer body again divided into two horizontal parts using flex elements named “quick-links” and “social-media”. It contains quick navigation links and social media links. 

Others:- 
I added some Media queries in my CSS file to make the webpage responsive. Also, I used some CSS dividers named “divider” and "footer-divider" to divide sections for better organizing in the webpage. Even though I added only a simple JavaScript function for basic form submission, I plan to add more dynamic features in the future.

As a beginner this project helped me a lot to apply the knowledge I gained throughout the course and improve my skills in web development. Thank you for reading my brief introduction.
